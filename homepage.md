## When

This year The Data Institute will return to its two-week in person form and take place July 10-21, with a welcome event on July 9.

## Where

The Data Institute will take place in Washington, DC on the campus of Howard University.

## Who

If you’re a journalism student, journalism professor or journalist passionate about learning how to use data, design and code to help tell stories, this workshop is for you. You don’t need to have any previous experience, but we want to see that you’ve demonstrated curiosity about telling stories with data. Have you tinkered with data, design or code? You’ll be able to tell us in the application.

If you’ve ever felt intimidated by learning to code and doing math, don’t count yourself out, because we’ve all been there. Most of the teachers you’ll have at the Data Institute majored in the humanities, such as Journalism, English, History or Philosophy.

All workshop students will need to use their own laptop, which must be able to install software like R Studio. This means that Chromebooks and iPads won’t work. We’ll provide other materials, including links to where you can get the software we’ll be using for free.

You must be an Ida B. Wells Society member to apply. Membership is free and [you can sign up here](http://idabwellssociety.org/membership/).

## More information

We'll update this site with more details and the applicatoin on May 10. You can learn more about prior Data Institutes [on our prior site](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/ida-propublica-data-institute).
