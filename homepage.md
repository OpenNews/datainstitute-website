## About the program

The Data Institute is a free, hands-on workshop that will cover the basics of understanding and manipulating data, how to apply design principles and layout to stories and how to code your own interactive project. In addition to training sessions on data journalism, design and programming that are taught by experienced journalists, participants will also meet and talk to leading journalists about their careers.

Co-founded in 2015 by two women and journalists of color, Sisi Wei and Lena Groeger, the Data Institute seeks to address an equity gap and make high-quality training more accessible for all journalists who want to tell powerful stories. The Data Institute equips journalists from a broad array of social, ethnic and economic backgrounds with the technical skills to create and lead data journalism, including but not limited to people of color, women and nonbinary people, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities.
