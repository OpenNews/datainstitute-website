## About the program

The Data Institute is a free, hands-on workshop that will teach you how to work with data as a journalist, how to apply design principles and layout to charts or stories, and how to code your own interactive project. In addition to training sessions on data journalism, design and programming that are taught by experienced journalists, participants will also meet and talk to leading journalists about their careers.

Co-founded in 2015 by two women and journalists of color, Sisi Wei and Lena Groeger, the Data Institute seeks to address an equity gap and make high-quality training more accessible for all journalists who want to tell powerful stories. The Data Institute equips journalists from a broad array of social, ethnic and economic backgrounds with the technical skills to create and lead data journalism, including but not limited to people of color, women and nonbinary people, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities.


## What you'll learn

Over two weeks, we'll cover the basics of using data, design and code for journalism. By the end of the course you should be able to:

**Data Journalism**

* Conduct data research and evaluate the reliability of your data.
* Clean data and analyze data sets for interesting trends and outliers.
* Bulletproof data against common pitfalls and inconsistencies.
* Perform the most commonly used statistical techniques in journalism.

**Design**

* Sketch and prototype multiple designs for a single project and evaluate the best approach.
* Learn how to use color, typography and layout.
* Create clear and clean visualizations to help readers understand complex information.

**Programming**

* Understand basic programming concepts.
* Create your own website from scratch, using HTML/CSS and Javascript.
* Understand how you might use AI in different ways to help your work as a journalist.
* Know how to continue learning on your own.

The workshop will be hands-on and participants will be working through exercises throughout the workshop.

## When + Where

The Data Institute is a two-week, in-person event from July 8-19 on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C.


<span id="who"></span>

## Who

If you’re a journalist passionate about learning how to use data, design and code to help tell stories, this workshop is for you. _You don’t need to have any previous experience_, but we want to see that you’ve demonstrated curiosity about telling stories with data. 

The Data Institute’s home is the Center for Journalism & Democracy at Howard University, and we’re especially excited to welcome applicants from HBCUs—alumni, professors, and current students. In addition, we strongly encourage applications from members of tribal nations, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, the Asian and Pacific Islander communities, and other groups historically left out of opportunities such as these.

If you’ve ever felt intimidated by learning to code and doing math, don’t count yourself out, because we’ve all been there. Most of the teachers you’ll have at the Data Institute majored in the humanities, such as journalism, English, history or philosophy.

All workshop students will need to use their own laptop, which must be able to install software like R Studio. This means that Chromebooks and iPads won’t work. We’ll provide other materials, including links to where you can get the software we’ll be using for free.

You must be an Ida B. Wells Society member to apply. Membership is free and [you can sign up here](https://idabwellssociety.org/membership-account/membership-levels/).

## More information
We'll update this site with more details and the application on May 10. You can learn more about earlier Data Institutes [on our prior site](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/ida-propublica-data-institute).-->


<span id="free"></span>

## It's Free

The Data Institute is completely free to attend. We will cover roundtrip travel costs to Washington, D.C., and provide lodging on the campus at Howard University. We’ll also provide lunch and snacks every day of the Institute.

In addition, every participant will receive a $1,000 stipend to supplement other needs or replace lost income while participating in the program.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**When will you be notifying applicants on whether they've been selected?**

We will begin reviewing applications after the April 25 deadline has passed, and will notify all applicants by May 15 if they’ve been selected.

**I'm not a U.S. resident. Am I eligible to apply?**

No. The Data Institute is only open to U.S. residents.

**What do you mean by U.S. resident? Can you make any exceptions to this rule?**

U.S. residents are [U.S. citizens or resident aliens](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Determining-Alien-Tax-Status). We will not be making any exceptions to this rule.

**Will you make the course material available online?**

Yes, just like [past](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/data-institute-2022) [workshops](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/data-institute-2019), we plan to publish a package of materials and online resources that we’ll make available for free.

**I'm not a journalism student, I'm not working in journalism and I don’t plan to work as a journalist in the future. Am I eligible to apply?**

No. While we understand that all of the skills we'll be teaching can be valuable in many fields, the Data Institute's mission is to help increase the number of journalists with data, design and programming skills. Therefore, only applicants who are studying to be journalists, working in journalism, or have demonstrated an interest in journalism will be considered.

**I am a journalism professor, am I eligible to apply?**

Yes!

**What will the hours be? Will I need to take off work?**

The Data Institute will run all day on weekdays between July 8 to July 19. We will also have a welcome dinner the evening of July 7, where we'll make sure everyone's laptop is set up for classwork. There will be assignments and project work that will likely occupy some of your evenings and weekends—we’re going to pack a lot of information into these two weeks, so applicants must be able to dedicate the entire time to the program. If this poses a financial burden that would make you unable to attend the workshop, we hope the $1,000 stipend for each participant helps mitigate that issue.

**Can I attend the Data Institute online?**

No, we are not offering remote participation in the Data Institute.

**Who organizes the Data Institute?**

The Data Institute is a collaborative project of the [Center for Journalism & Democracy](https://cfjd.howard.edu/) and the [Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting](https://idabwellssociety.org/). The program was [developed at ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/ida-propublica-data-institute), which continues to support the project, and [OpenNews](https://opennews.org/) helps coordinate planning and participation. Major financial support is provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation as part of the CJD’s Investigative Journalism for Health Equity Project.
